			<h1>How to Become a Millionaire</h1>
			<p>Not a desire for status or a lavish lifestyle, but rather for financial security should be the driving force behind the quest of money. A seven-digit net worth is a reachable objective if you start young and form the appropriate financial habits. Jason Flurry, CFP, founder and president of Legacy Partners Financial Group in Woodstock, Georgia, has discovered in his work with wealthy clients that those he refers to as "true millionaires," people who acquire wealth and maintain it, view the role of money in their lives very differently from those who place more emphasis on what money can buy. "Being rich" or having money for the sake of having money never makes a person feel content, according to him. Ironically, it can result in a different set of issues for the majority of people.</p>
			<h2>1. Have a Witten Financial Plan</h2>
			<p>You won't get wealthy just by declaring your desire for it. You must develop a practical <span>plan</span>, document it, and then carry it out. "The written plan drives you to do something," says Stewart Welch, founder of The Welch Group, a wealth management company in Birmingham, Alabama. "Calculate what you need to earn and how to invest." The dream, the goals, and the possibilities are all part of the plan, not just the goal. The choices necessitate "scenario planning," which involves thinking of all the possible methods to achieve that objective, such as starting a Roth IRA or contributing to a 401(k), according to Welch.

			<p>Buying a large residence or buying a pricely car is too massive a price to pay if it will <span>decrease the amount of cash you can save and invest.</span>
			"This is usually one of my prefered monetary mantras," Hamrick says. "Too many indivinduals or consumers, are conditioned to suppose-or allow themselves to suppose- that their self-confidence is come what may tied to their peersonal possessions
			People who are serious about becoming Millionaires for financial safety are much more less likely to blow money on pricely vehicles and lavish vacations
			And they are not going to purchase a residence that stretches their budget too thin. Use a Bankkrate's house calculater to decide how an awful lot residence you can truely affords.

			<h2>3. Avoid Debts</h2>
			<p><span>Debt is your enemy</span>. It's better to pay yourself than paying a bank or paying a credit-score card compaany
			When you're on deebt it is very difficult to make progress towards securing your monetary future becaus you have to pay your taxes and your debts before you can use aany of your cashfor you
			Musk says you have to <span>avoid what we call "dump debt,"</span> such as credit score cards, acr loans and most student loans
			If you have a stack of credit card bills, pay them off and maintain just one or none. Try no longer to put so things on your pplaying cards that you can't pay off in one or two Months
			Debt holds humans back. Musk added, 'They make purchase liabilities and they make those repayments forever'
